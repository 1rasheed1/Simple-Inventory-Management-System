# Simple-Inventory-Management-System
In this console-based application, I'll create a basic inventory management system. This system will allow a user to manage a list of products, where each product has a name, price, and quantity in stock.

### Here are the main functionalities the system has:

•	**Add a product**: Prompt the user for the product name, price, and quantity.

•	**View all products**: Display a list of all products in the inventory, along with their prices and quantities.

•	**Edit a product**: Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, allow the user to update its name, price, or quantity.

•	**Delete a product**: Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, remove it.

•	**Search for a product**: Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, display its name, price, and quantity. If not, let the user know the product was not found.
